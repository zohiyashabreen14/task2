I created an interactive sales dashboard to analyze online sales performance. The dashboard highlights key metrics such as total revenue, units sold, unit price, and product/region counts. Key insights include:

January was the highest revenue month, while July was the lowest.

The most used payment method was credit card.

Total revenue was 80.5K+ with 518 units sold across 240 products and regions.

Visuals include:

Monthly revenue trends

Unit price vs. units sold

Payment methods by product category

Product-wise sales distribution
